Nozoki
=======

What is it?
-----------

Nozoki is intended to be a stealth game with:

* Enemies with AI that chase the player
* Randomly generated series of rooms
* A goal of finding the "exit" of the dungeon

Code style standards
--------------------

For my own sake, I figured I'd write this out and stick to it.

* Opening brace on separate line
* Spaces between non cast parens and the inside text (ie "if( 1 == 1 ){}")
* 8 space indent
* if-statements ALWAYS have braces
* Camel case, member variable prefixed with lower case "m"
* Function and variable declarations in classes separated
